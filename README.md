# Twitch-Parrot

Twitch-Parrot is a Node.js application designed to bring live text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities to Twitch chats, using AWS Polly API. It allows streamers and viewers to interact in real-time with customizable voice messages, enhancing the streaming experience.

## Features

- **Customizable Command Trigger:** Set a command prefix that, when used in chat, activates the TTS feature.
- **Voice Customization:** Choose from a [variety of voices available through AWS Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html) to find the one that best suits your stream's personality.
- **Message Length Control:** Limit the length of messages that can be converted to speech, preventing abuse.
- **User Cooldown:** Manage how often a viewer can send a TTS message, preventing spam.
